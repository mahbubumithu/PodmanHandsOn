## What is a Container?

A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, enabling consistent behavior across different environments.

### Containers are particularly useful because they:

- Reduce system overhead compared to traditional virtual machines.
- Provide easy, fast deployment and scaling.
- Ensure software behaves the same regardless of where it is deployed.

### Popular Container Technologies:

- Docker
- Podman
- LXC (Linux Containers)
