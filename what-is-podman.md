## What is Podman?

Podman is a container engine, similar to Docker, that allows you to run, manage, and build containers and images. Unlike Docker, Podman is daemonless and does not require a root user, making it more secure. Additionally, it has built-in support for managing pods, which makes it a popular choice for developing applications that will eventually run in a Kubernetes environment.

### Key Features of Podman:

- Daemonless Architecture: No background daemon is required, reducing security risks.
- Rootless Containers: Can run containers without requiring root access.
- Kubernetes Compatibility: Supports running pods and creating YAML files compatible with Kubernetes.
- Docker-Compatible Commands: Most Docker commands work with Podman (such as podman run instead of docker run).
